# Practicum Project 4

## Around The U.S.

This is the fourth project for the Practicum Web Development bootcamp. It's an interactive page called 'Around The U.S.' where users can do the following:

- change the profile picture by providing a link to their desired picture.
- change the username and about section.
- upload an image by providing a name and link to the image.

All forms have validation and users are only able to delete images that they have uploaded, and not someone else's images.

The webpage is fully responsive and created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The BEM methodology has been applied to structure both CSS and project files.

This project is deployed using github pages.
